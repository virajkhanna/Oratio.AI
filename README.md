# Oratio.AI
Oratio.AI is your AI-powered practice tool to do all things debate - from practicing rebuttal, to understanding how to write better speeches, to working on generated speeches! Write smarter, speak stronger, effortlessly, and let Oratio.AI take care of the rest!

### How to Use
Try any feature of Oratio.AI, however you want! Click "Try It" on the home page to try out the speech generator, and simply enter a motion (Ex. This house would regulate the use of Artificial Intelligence), a word limit (Ex. 500 words), and a side (Proposition - supporting, or Opposition - against), while being able to choose between multiple forms of debate (Asian Parliamentary, British Parliamentary)!

To check the quality of your speech and recieve feedback on it, head over to the "Speech Checker"! Enter the motion the speech was based on, the side of the speech, and the type of debate it was written for! Next, enter your speech in the textbox below, and as you click "Check It!", watch as feedback comes in, telling you the best parts of your speech and parts you can improve!

If you want to check your rebuttal, go to the "Rebuttal Practice" page! Enter a motion, a side and a form of debate, and click "Generate Speech" to generate a speech. Once a speech is generated, write some rebuttal for the speech in the textbox for rebuttal, and click "Get Rebuttal Feedback" to get feedback on your rebuttal!
